The tracking id is for lux-services.com
4 google analytics:

Tracking ID
UA-91400616-1

Using WordPress
To track every page on this site
Enter this script in to
header.php just above the wphead() call

<script>
  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
  })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

  ga('create', 'UA-91400616-1', 'auto');
  ga('send', 'pageview');

</script>

Go thru the process of signing up for google analytics to get a customized version of the above script.
Each must be unique  The UA number is different for each site.

Then get the Monsterinsights for google analytics plugin
It used to be part of the yoast package but got sold off.
Said to be in good hands, maintenance wise.
gotta find out more

good utube follow along lessons on setting it up.

when making one's own implementation or using
Other frameworks you might want to do it this way

the word is to include it in the header of your page
before any other CSS or JavaScripts


For a Bootstrap or other page by page PHP Implementation
((So one does not end up with a copy paste errors))
create a file using custom version of above script.
name it analyticstracking.php

And call it by Adding something like the following line early in each page :

<?php include_once("analyticstracking.php") ?>
or
less popular
referencing it in a script tag

Or
For Dynamic Content frameworks or Implementations
much like wordpress above
Use a common include or template to paste the code above instead of manually adding it to every page.
It's just that every system will have it's own best place to do that, just need to determine where.


later in the follow along video there is a part about verifying and testing.
use that to finish verifying and setting up Analytics.

Now:
There is something called a tag
So far this is using one tag
All sites need to be able to manage more than one tag
but as of this moment Google analytics is set up.

Next is to install

Google Tag Manager

 As soon there will be many tags to manage.
